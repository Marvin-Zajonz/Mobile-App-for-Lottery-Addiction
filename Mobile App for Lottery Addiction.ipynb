    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",

This project aims to provide the logical core of the app. Key questions that should be answered by the app should be:\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",

We were using probabilistic methods and theories like factorials, events, and outcomes to generate the probabilities. Furthermore, we were using a data set that includes the winning numbers of over 30 years of the Candian lottery to demonstrate the low chances of winning the lottery. "
