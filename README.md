# Mobile-App-for-Lottery-Addiction

In this project we'll be working for a fictional medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions and wants to build an mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. This project aims to provide the logical core of the app. Key questions that should be answered by the app should be:
- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?

These questions will be answered for the lottery in the 6/49 format. Furthermore, data coming from the national lottery game in Candada will be included in the considerations. The data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) and contains 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018. <br><br>
The goal of this project will be to apply statistical methods with a big focus on probability.
